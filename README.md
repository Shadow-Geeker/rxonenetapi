RxOneNetApi
===========
China Mobile OneNet Android api  using Retrofit2 and RxJava2

#### Note: This libaray is still under testing, so be careful to use it. If you find some errors or problems, please let me know.<br>
  And still, the library has no error handler such as HTTP 404 error or other, so you must do by yourself. I will add these features when I am free.
